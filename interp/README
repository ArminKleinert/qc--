Known Issues ::

 [client]

    * Not all C standard library functions are registered.  In fact, only a
      few are (e.g., malloc, free, printf, exit, and others).
    * The registration of printf is special yet is not documented.

 [runtime system]

    * Cmm_FindStackData is unimplemented.
    * Cmm_RunThread is no longer in the language definition, yet is required by
      this implementation in order to run a thread.
    * We use static boot-up code to pass an argument off to an initial C--
      procedure; unfortunately, this means that a newly created thread would
      be suspended at the boot-up procedure and not the initial procedure.
      This would be noticeable when observed through the runtime system.

 [interpreter]

    * Mutual dependencies among separate assembly units is not allowed for now.
    * When calls are made from a C-- procedure to a C-- procedure, the caller's
      activation record indicates that it is suspended at (has a PC of) the
      address of the instruction immediately following the call--not at the
      call site itself.
      This would be noticeable when observed through the runtime system.
    * Not all common C function signatures are registered; this will need to
      be modified in order to accomodate more varied sorts of C functions.
    * 64-bit ints are not currently supported, nor are floats larger than
      32-bits wide.
    * Cuts across different threads are 100% untested; unexpected behavior
      might occur.
          - Consider this situation: a procedure 'p' contains a continuation
            'cont'.  At runtime, an activation of 'p' calls itself, and
            then that activation calls itself--leaving 3 live activations.
            When this youngest activation of 'p' cuts to 'cont', which
            activation record is cut to?
    * LIMITCHECK instruction unimplemented.

 [translation from compiler]

    * Stackdata translation unimplemented.
    * "Cut to" is not properly translated.
    * Continuations are not properly translated.
    * Rounding modes are not properly translated.
    * Interpreter is not told correct number of global registers.

    * Translation of guarded-RTLs is not tested.
