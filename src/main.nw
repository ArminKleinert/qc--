\section{Main}

This module contains the [[main]] function that is executed when the
\C~compiler starts.  Its main purposes are command line processing,
catching of exceptions, and providing the exit code.

The [[Main]] module opens the modules it most frequently uses:

<<main.ml>>=
open Pc                         (* parser combinators for cmd line *)
open Error			(* error handling *)

@ The module [[Arg]] for command line processing from the standard
library enforces an imperative programming style and can not be used
to parse highly structured command lines.  We use parser combinators
from module [[Pc]] for command line processing that capture the
structure of the command line in an abstract syntax tree which then is
processed. 

The data type [[cmd]] describes the abstract syntax of the command
line; it is defined in module [[Cmdline]].  Currently the structure is
very simple:  the command line can ask the program for different
actions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Display a usage information.
\item Display a version information.
\item Scan a file and show the token stream.
\item Parse a file and serialize it in \asdl~format.
\item Parse a file and pretty print it for a given line width.
\end{enumerate}

<<cmdline.mli>>=
type cmd =        | Help                                               
                  | Version                                  
                  | Lex      of string
                  | Asdl     of string
                  | Pp       of string * int
                  | Check    of string

@ The concrete syntax of the command line is specified through the
parser combinators that recognizes them. The [[Pc]] module defines
several infix operators which makes the notation of parser combinators
rather suggestive: [[***]], [[**>]], and [[**<]] recognize a sequence
of tokens; [[**>]] returns only the string of the right hand side as a
semantic value. Semantic values are processed by functions defined on
the right hand side of [[-->]]. The string recognized by [[any]] after
a flag [[-pp] is passed to a function that injects the string into a
[[Pp]] constructor that asks to parse and pretty print a file.
  
<<main.ml>>=

let default_width = 72 

let cmd_help      = literal "-help"         --> return Cmdline.Help
let cmd_version   = literal "-version"      --> return Cmdline.Version
let cmd_lex       = literal "-lex" **> any  --> fun s -> Cmdline.Lex(s) 
let cmd_asdl      = literal "-asdl" **> any --> fun s -> Cmdline.Asdl(s) 
let cmd_check     = literal "-check" **> any --> fun s -> Cmdline.Check(s) 
let cmd_default   = any                     --> fun s -> Cmdline.Pp(s,default_width)

let cmd_width     = literal "-w" **> any    
                    --> fun s -> (try  int_of_string s 
                                  with Failure(_) -> default_width)
                    
let cmd_pp        = (literal "-pp" **> cmd_width *** any 
                    --> fun (width,file) -> Cmdline.Pp(file,width)) 
                ||| literal "-pp" **> any 
                    --> fun (file)       -> Cmdline.Pp(file,default_width)
                    

@ Each parser recognizes a complete command line.  As an abbreviation
a single file name without flags is interpreted as an argument to the
[[-pp]] flag. 

The structure of the whole command line is recognized by the
[[cmdline]] parser: it simply recognizes the first successfully parsed
command line. The end of the command line that is recognized by
[[eof]] must terminate a successfully parsed token sequence in order
for [[cmdline]] to be successful.

<<main.ml>>=
let cmdline       = (  cmd_version 
                   ||| cmd_help 
                   ||| cmd_lex
                   ||| cmd_asdl 
                   ||| cmd_pp
                   ||| cmd_check
                   ||| cmd_default 
                    ) **< eof

@ The command line flags [[-version]] and [[-help]] trigger short
messages going to stdout.  The [[usage]] function is also called from
[[main]] when the command line syntax is wrong.

@ The [[main]] function gets the command line arguments and tries to
parse them using the [[cmdline]] parser.  It returns the abstract
syntax as defined in Module [[Cmdline]] which is used to decide which
function to call.  In case of no error all functions return here and
the program end with exit code zero.  However, in case of an error the
[[Error]] exception is raised and caught here.  This leads to a non
zero exit code.

Writing manual pages for the Troff formatter is a tedious job.  I have
found the highly readable \textit{plain old document} (\textsc{pod})
format used by the Perl community very helpful.  Every Perl
installation comes with a \texttt{pod2man} tool which creates a man
page from \textsc{pod} file.  Today we can assume that Perl is
installed nearly everywhere such that the use of this tool does not
spoils portability of our code.

The format of \textsc{pod} files is documented in the \texttt{perlpod}
manual page.  Besides the \texttt{pod2man} filter there exist other
filters to convert a \textsc{pod} file to \textsc{html} and \LaTeX,
which makes it a very versatile format.

=head1 NAME

qc-- - the quick c-- compiler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<qc-- -version>

B<qc-- -help>

B<qc-- -lex> I<file>

B<qc-- -asdl> I<file>

B<qc-- -pp> [ B<-w> I<width> ] I<file>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<qc--> compiles C-- code. The compiler is still in its infancy and
does not many useful things yet. 

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-version>

Report the version of B<qc--> to stdout.

=item B<-help>

Print short usage to stdout.

=item B<-asdl> I<file>

Parse I<file> and print the abstract syntax in ASDL format to stdout.

=item B<-pp> [ B<-w> I<width> ]I<file>

Parse I<file> and write a pretty printed concrete syntax to stdout. 
The default width for output is 72 characters; it can be changed with the
B<-w> flag. 

=item B<-lex> I<file>

Scan (lex) I<file> and write a representation of the tokens in I<file> 
to stdout.

To include some version information into the main binary we provide
the [[This]] module.  Its source code [[this.ml]] is created during
the build process from [[this.in]].  Currently only the version
information stays here but it is a useful place for other informations
that change frequently.

<<this.in>>=
(* do not edit - this file is created from this.in through make(1) *)

let system	    = "@this@"
let architecture    = "@arch@"

@ The functions [[name]] and [[version]] decompose the [[system]]
string to get the name and version of the system. 

<<this.in>>=
let name =

    let minus = String.index system '-' in
      String.sub system 0 minus
