\section{Support for forward dataflow problems}


A dataflow pass is based on a single dataflow fact of type~[['a]].
Values of type~[['a]] should form a lattice.
The dataflow engine uses the lattice structure to compute a least
solution to a set of dataflow equations.
The engine works by starting at the bottom and iterating to a fixed
point, so we require the
bottom element, a join (least upper bound) operation, and a comparison
to find out if a value has changed (grown).
<<exported types>>=
type 'a fact = 'a Dataflowp.fact = {
  fact_name : string;                     (* documentation *)
  init_info : 'a;                         (* lattice bottom element *)
  add_info  : 'a -> 'a -> 'a;             (* lattice join (least upper bound) *)
  changed   : old:'a -> new':'a -> bool;  (* is new one bigger? *)
  prop      : 'a Unique.Prop.t;           (* access to mutable state by uid *)
}
@ Finally, we require a way to store dataflow facts in global mutable
state, associated with unique IDs.  This capability is provided by the
[[prop]] field.
@
The computation of a fact is the basis of a dataflow pass.
A~computation takes not one but two type parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Type parameter [['i]] is an input, from which it should be possible to
derived a dataflow fact of interest.
For example, [['i]] might be equal to a fact, or it might be a tuple
of which one element is a fact.
\item
Type parameter [['o]] is an output.
\end{itemize}
<<exported types>>=
type 'a edge_fact_setter = (Zipcfg.uid -> 'a -> unit) -> unit
type 'a answer = Dataflow of 'a | Rewrite of Zipcfg.graph

type ('i, 'om, 'ol) computation =
 { name       : string;
   middle_out : 'i -> Zipcfg.Rep.middle -> 'om;
   last_outs  : 'i -> Zipcfg.Rep.last -> 'ol;
 } 
@ 
From these elements we build several kinds of passes:
\begin{itemize}
\item
A pure analysis computes a fact, using that fact as input and
output.
\item
A~pure transformation computes no facts but only changes the graph.
\item
A fully general pass both computes a fact and rewrites the graph.
\end{itemize}
<<exported types>>=
type 'a analysis       = 'a fact * ('a, 'a, 'a edge_fact_setter) computation
type 'a pass           = 'a fact * ('a, 'a answer, 'a edge_fact_setter answer) computation
type 'a transformation = ('a, Zipcfg.graph option, Zipcfg.graph option) computation
@ Still to come: composition operators.
@
WE NEED TO TRACK THINGS TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE GRAPH HAS CHANGED AS A
RESULT OF RUNNING A PASS.

The Boolean result tells if the graph changed.

@ 
\paragraph{Composition operators}
Here we will make new passes from old ones.

We can make an analysis pass, or we can 
 combine a related analysis and transformation into a full pass.

@ 
In a backward problem, we compute \emph{in} facts from \emph{out}
facts.
The analysis gives us [[last_in]], [[middle_in]], and [[first_in]],
each of which computes an \emph{in} fact for one kind of node.
We provide [[head_in]], which computes the \emph{in} fact for a first
node followed by zero or more middle nodes.

We don't compute and return the \emph{in} fact for block; instead, we
use [[P.set]] to attach that fact to the block's unique~ID.
We iterate until no more facts have changed.

@ 
In the general case we solve a graph in the context of a larger subgraph.
To do this, we need a locally modified computation that allows an
``exit fact'' to flow out of the exit node.
<<utilities>>=
let comp_with_exit comp exit_fact_ref =
  let last_outs in' l = match l with
  | GR.Exit -> Dataflow (fun set -> exit_fact_ref := in')
  | _ -> comp.last_outs in' l in
  { comp with last_outs = last_outs } 
@ 
Given this function, we can now solve a graph simply by doing a
backward analysis on the modified computation.

@
We solve and rewrite in two passes: the first pass iterates to a fixed
point to reach a dataflow solution, and the second pass uses that
solution to rewrite the graph.

The
key job is done by [[propagate]], which propagates a fact of type~[['a]]
between a head and tail.
The tail is in final form; the head is still to be rewritten.
