\section{Abstract CFG Interface}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The dynamic part of a procedure is represented by a control flow
graph:  nodes represent statements, and edges possible flow of control
between statements.  This interface allows to build a control flow
graph for a procedure.  Many aspects are left abstract to foster
different implementations.

The interface is divided into two parts:  the first defines types that
are used in the interface and also shared among all implementations. 
The second part defines a module type [[S]] that describes the
interface for building a flow graph. 

<<acfg.mli>>=
<<shared types>>
module type S = sig
    <<signature S>>
end
@

<<acfg.ml>>=
<<shared types>>
module type S = sig
    <<signature S>>
end
@


% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Shared Types}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The abstract interface defines some types that are used in the
interface and that are shared among all implementations of the
interface.  The goal is to have no generative type declarations in the
main signature [[S]] to facilitate stacked implementations. In a
stacked implementation, a control flow graph is defined in terms of a
another, possibly lower-level, implementation.

A control flow graph contains shared nodes.  To express this sharing
at the level of the interface, some nodes are referred to by name.  A
name can be used as a reference even \emph{before} the node labeled
with that name is defined.  The interface demands nodes to be labeled
that are likely to be labeled in the {\PAL} source code as well.

A classical flow graph contains no labels:  edges between nodes
express the connection between nodes and there is no need to use names
for this.  In this particular case however, labels are represented as
nodes with one successor.  The purpose of these nodes is to store
names for labels in the [[cfg]] which can be used when the [[cfg]] is
transformed or visualized.  Since a label $l$ and its successor $x$
are two different nodes, $x$ can be reached directly in the graph and
not only by paths via $l$---this is completely legal. 

Continuations can be used to model exception handling. Nodes that can
transfer control to a continuation are annotated with a [[cuts]] value
that lists the different possible nodes/continuations.

<<shared types>>=
type label      = string
type cuts =     { cuts    : label list
                ; unwinds : label list
                ; returns : label list
                ; aborts  : bool
                }
@

When arguments and results to and from procedures are passed around
with [[copy]] nodes, a [[context]] value identifies the exact purpose
of a copy.  This information is necessary to find the right calling
convention to implement the copying. 
                           
<<>>=
type context    = ProcParameters
                | ProcResults
                | ContParameters
@


A formal parameter is a variable, an actual parameter an expression. 
Both can have optional hints, and have a [[width]], i.e.~a type. 

<<>>=
type formal =   { name:      string 
                ; width:     Rtl.width       (* bits *)
                ; hint:      string option   (* C-- hint *)
                ; index:     int             (* run-time API *)
                } 

type actual     = Rtl.expr 
                * Rtl.width 
                * string option               (* hint *)
@


% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Constructor Functions}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The constructor functions below build a flow graph [[cfg]].  A flow
graph is initialized with an implementation dependent value [[init]]. 
Every [[node]] belongs to exactly one flow graph that is returned by
[[cfg_of]] when applied to the [[node]]. 

<<signature S>>=
type cfg        (* control flow graph *)
type node       (* a node in a cfg    *)
type unode      (* unmarked node      *)
type init       (* initializes a cfg  *)

val create:     init -> cfg
val cfg_of:     node -> cfg
@

Nodes have to have properties---notably, span bindings.  We don't want
to have to pass properties to every node-creation function.  So
instead, we add a new type:  [[unode]], for ``unmarked node.'' We then
use [[bind]] to add properties.

\begin{itemize}
\item Span bindings allow to mark regions of source code with a
      compile-time constant key, and a link-time constant value.
\item Comments attached to nodes by [[add_comment]] help to debug
      generated code. A comment must not contain a newline character. 
\end{itemize}

<<>>=
module Props : sig 
    type t          (* properties *)

    val empty       : t
    val add_span    : Bits.bits -> Rtl.const -> t -> t
    val add_comment : string -> t -> t 
end    
    
val bind : Props.t -> unode -> node
@

A labeled node can be referenced by name (using a [[label]] value)
that must be unique within a [[cfg]].  As noted above, a [[label]] can
be used before it is attached to a node and thus allows to express
sharing of nodes. 

<<>>=
(* label *)
val label:      label -> node -> unode
@

A control flow graph is built from back to front, starting with the
unique [[exit]] node of a procedure, and moving to the unique
[[entry]] node.  The following functions create nodes that change the
flow of control or end a procedure.  Target nodes for jumps and
exceptions are referenced by name. 

All construction functions take [[nodes]] as arguments but create
[[unode]] values, that is, unmarked nodes.  An [[unode]] is
transformed into a [[node]] by [[bind]]'ing properties [[Props.t]] to
it.

A [[return]] node denotes which return-continuation to be used upon
its return.  The first [[int]] value is the number of the continuation
to be used at its point of return, the other the total number of
continuation at its point of return.

<<>>=
(* 0 successor nodes *)
val exit:       cfg -> unode
val goto:       cfg -> Rtl.expr -> label list -> unode
val jump:       cfg -> Rtl.expr -> label list -> unode
val cutto:      cfg -> Rtl.expr -> cuts       -> unode
val return:     cfg -> int -> int             -> unode
@

The following nodes are lying on a control flow path and thus have a
single successor.  For calls the normal point of return is given as a
[[node]], all exceptional points of return by name by a [[cuts]]
value. 

Copy-in and copy-out nodes carry informations about formal and actual
parameters, the calling convention to be used, and their [[context]]. 

<<>>=
(* 1 successor node *)
val entry:      node -> unode                   (* unique entry node *)
val assign:     Rtl.rtl -> node -> unode
val copyi:      formal list -> context -> Target.conv -> node -> unode
val copyo:      actual list -> context -> Target.conv -> node -> unode
val call:       Rtl.expr -> node -> cuts -> unode 
@

A [[branch]] node has two successors: the first is taken when its
expression evaluates to true, and the other otherwise. Since a control flow
graph is built from the bottom up, both successors are known when the
branching point is reached.

<<>>=
(* 2 successor nodes *)
val branch  : Rtl.expr -> node -> node -> unode
@

\section{CFG Implementation}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

This module implements the abstract CFG interface and provides the
lowest level implementation for the {\qcc} compiler.  Despite what the
interface says, this implementation does not provide [[copyi/o]]
nodes.  We expect them to be implemented as a sequence of [[assign]]
nodes by a higher level implementation.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Interface}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

This module implements the abstract CFG interface plus some extras.
The latter include a way to translate a control flow graph back into
abstract {\PAL} syntax to make is visible via pretty-printing. This
translation requires some knowledge about the sizes of pointers and
the like and is provided as a functor argument of type [[TARGET]] to
functor [[Make]].

<<cfg.mli>>=
module type TARGET = sig
    val t: Target.info
end

module Make (T: TARGET): sig
    include Acfg.S

    (* extras *)
    module Map:     Map.S with type key = node
    val init:       cfg -> init
    val stmts:      cfg -> (string -> string) -> Ast.stmt list
    
end with
    type init = string * Fenv.Clean.proc
@

% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Implementation - Building the CFG}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Nodes are identified by integer [[id]]s. A [[cfg] maintains a counter
[[nid]] which is used to generate fresh [[id]]s for nodes. Every node 
includes the [[cfg]] it belongs to. 

<<cfg.ml>>=
module type TARGET = sig
    val t: Target.info
end

module Make (T: TARGET) = struct
    <<module Make>>
end

<<module Make>>=
type init       = string * Fenv.Clean.proc
type id         = int

module Props = struct
    <<module Props>>
end

type cfg =      { init:             init
                ; mutable entry:    node option
                ; mutable exit:     node option
                ; by_label:         (string,node) Hashtbl.t
                ; mutable nid:      id          (* counter for node id *)
                }

and node =      { cfg:              cfg         (* cfg this b!}elongs to *)
                ; id:               id          (* unique with cfg       *)
                ; mutable pred:     node list   (* predecessors          *)
                ; mutable props:    Props.t     (* properties            *)
                ; mutable kind:     kind        (* details               *)
                }
and unode =     Props.t -> node


@

The [[kind]] field of a [[node]] details the node's purpose.  A
special kind [[Deferred]] is uses for [[Label]] nodes which are
referenced by name, but haven't been defined yet.  These are entered
into the [[by_label]] table of the [[cfg]] and given the [[Deferred]]
kind.  When the corresponding node is defined, all missing
informations will be added.

<<>>=
and  kind       = Deferred
                (* end of a path *) 
                | Exit
                | Goto              of Rtl.expr * node list     
                | Jump              of Rtl.expr * node list
                | Cutto             of Rtl.expr * cuts
                | Return            of int * int
                (* one successor *)
                | Entry             of node
                | Call              of Rtl.expr * node * cuts
                | Assign            of Rtl.rtl * node
                | Label             of Acfg.label * node
                (* two successors *)
                | Branch            of Rtl.expr * node * node
@

Continuations, that a [[call] or [[cutto]] node may reach, are
represented as nodes and no longer as labels as they are in the
interface.

<<>>=
and cuts =      { cuts:             node list
                ; unwinds:          node list
                ; returns:          node list
                ; aborts:           bool
                }
@

Nodes can be ordered based on their unique [[id]]. We provide a
[[Compare]] module to be used with functors that create (ordered) maps
and sets of nodes.
               
<<>>=
module Compare = struct
    type t = node
    let compare x y = compare x.id y.id
end
@

Properties are modeled as functional records.  A [[node]] can have any
number of comments and can be part of any number of spans.

<<module Props>>=
type t =        { comments:         string list
                ; spans:            (Bits.bits * Rtl.const) list
                }
                        
let empty           = { comments = []; spans = [] }
let add_comment s t = { t with comments = s::t.comments  }
let add_span x y  t = { t with spans    = (x,y)::t.spans }                   
@

A [[unode]], as returned by all construction functions, is a function
taking a [[Props.t]] value and returning a [[node]] value.  Binding
is thus a simple application of the function to the [[Props.t]] value.
 
<<module Make>>=
let bind props unode = unode props
@

The [[unode]] construction functions below benefit from some helper
functions defined here.  All nodes are constructed by [[newNode]];
this function assigns a fresh [[id]] to the new node and initializes
the list of predecessors to the empty list.

<<>>=
let newNode cfg kind props =
    let _ = cfg.nid <- cfg.nid + 1 in
        { cfg   = cfg
        ; id    = cfg.nid
        ; pred  = []
        ; kind  = kind
        ; props = props
        }
@

When a node is referenced by name, it must be looked up.  In case the
node is not yet defined, a new [[Deferred]] node is created.  When
later a node of that name is defined, the [[kind]] field is updated;
see the [[labelStmt]] function for the details of this.

<<>>=        
let lookup cfg label =
    try  Hashtbl.find cfg.by_label label
    with Not_found ->
        let n = newNode cfg Deferred Props.empty in
        let _ = Hashtbl.add cfg.by_label label n in
            n
@

The [[cuts]] bundle in the interface references by name.  The
implementation references nodes directly and thus must look them up.

<<>>=
let lookup_cuts cfg c =
    { cuts    = List.map (lookup cfg) c.Acfg.cuts
    ; unwinds = List.map (lookup cfg) c.Acfg.unwinds
    ; returns = List.map (lookup cfg) c.Acfg.returns
    ; aborts  = c.Acfg.aborts
    }
@

Finally, here are the exported functions that create the graph.  An
empty [[cfg]] has neither entry, nor exit node and just stores the
[[init]] value.

<<>>=
let create init = 
    { init      = init
    ; entry     = None
    ; exit      = None
    ; by_label  = Hashtbl.create 100
    ; nid       = 0
    }
@

Each node contains its graph; the [[cfg_of]] functions returns a node's
[[cfg]]. 
    
<<>>=    
let cfg_of { cfg=g } = g
@

Below are all the functions that create nodes in the control flow
graph. Each function must update the list of predecessors of nodes it
refers to.

<<>>=
let exit cfg props = 
    let node = newNode cfg Exit props  in
    let _    = cfg.exit <- Some node   in       (* record exit in cfg *)
        node
@

An [[entry]] node is also registered in the [[graph]] and has a
successor, which is back-linked to the node at hand. 

<<>>=
let entry next props  = 
    let cfg   = cfg_of next                    in
    let node  = newNode cfg (Entry next) props in
    let _     = cfg.entry <- Some node         in
    let _     = next.pred <- node::next.pred   in
        node
@

A [[goto]] node links to all its successors. Successors are given by
name and thus must be looked up first.

<<>>=
let goto g expr labels props = 
    let succ = List.map (lookup g) labels                     in
    let n    = newNode g (Goto(expr,succ)) props              in
    let _    = List.iter (fun x -> x.pred <- n::x.pred) succ  in
        n
@

A [[branch]] has two successors, which are both back-linked via their
[[pred]] components.

<<>>=
let branch expr t f props =
    let node  = newNode (cfg_of t) (Branch (expr, t, f)) props   in
    let _     = t.pred <- node::t.pred                           in
    let _     = f.pred <- node::f.pred                           in
        node
@

An assignment is simple; is has a successor that must be linked in.

<<>>=
let assign rtl next props = 
    let node = newNode (cfg_of next) (Assign (rtl, next)) props in
    let _    = next.pred <- node::next.pred                       in
        node
@

No [[copy]] nodes are available, as explained above in the interface
section. 

<<>>=
let copyi  formals context cc next p = assert false
let copyo  actuals context cc next p = assert false
@

A [[return]] node has no successors.

<<>>=
let return g x y props = newNode g (Return (x,y)) props
@

A [[call]] takes an expression and a continuation bundle. The normal point
of return is the successor of the [[call]] node.

<<>>= 
let call expr next cuts props =
    let g    = cfg_of next      in
    let cuts = lookup_cuts g cuts in
    let node = newNode g (Call(expr,next,cuts)) props in
    let succ = next :: (List.flatten [cuts.cuts; cuts.unwinds; cuts.returns])in
    let _    = List.iter (fun x -> x.pred <- node :: x.pred) succ in
        node
@

A [[cutto]] and a [[jump]] node have no included successors.  All
successors are referenced by name and thus must be looked up.

<<>>=
let cutto g expr cuts props =
    let cuts = lookup_cuts g cuts                                   in
    let node = newNode g (Cutto(expr,cuts)) props                   in
    let succ = List.flatten [cuts.cuts; cuts.unwinds; cuts.returns] in
    let _    = List.iter (fun x -> x.pred <- node :: x.pred) succ   in
        node

let jump g expr labels props =
    let succ = List.map (lookup g) labels                      in
    let n    = newNode g (Jump (expr,succ)) props              in
    let _    = List.iter (fun x -> x.pred <- n :: x.pred) succ in
        n
@

A labeled node is registered in the graph's [[by_label]] table.  This
allows to find nodes which are referenced by name, like continuations
and targets for [[goto]].  When the label was used before its
definition there is a [[Deferred]] node in the [[by_label]] map.  We
simply update the [[Deferred]] kind of that node to [[Label]] and are
done. If the label was never used before, we directly create a
[[Label]] node and put it into the [[by_label]] map of the [[cfg]].

<<>>=
let label l node props =
    let g    = cfg_of node in
        try let n = Hashtbl.find g.by_label l in
            ( match n.kind with
            | Deferred -> 
                ( n.kind         <- Label(l,node)
                ; node.pred      <- n :: node.pred 
                ; n.props        <- 
                    { n.props with
                      Props.comments = n.props.Props.comments @ props.Props.comments
                    ; Props.spans    = n.props.Props.spans    @ props.Props.spans
                    }
                ; n
                )
            | _ -> assert false (* defined twice *)
            )
        with Not_found -> (* enter node to map and return node *)
            let n = newNode g (Label(l,node)) props in
            let _ = Hashtbl.add g.by_label l n      in
            let _ = node.pred <- n :: node.pred     in
                n
@

\subsection{Implementation - Translation to {\AST}}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

For debugging we would like to visualize the control flow graph. One
way of doing this is to translate a [[cfg]] back into {\PAL} syntax.
Technically a [[cfg]] is translated to {\PAL} abstract syntax (defined
in module \module{ast}).

The translation functions are grouped together in an internal module
[[Export]].  The traversal of the control flow graph requires to
remember the visited nodes.  Module [[NSet]] provides a set of nodes;
the identity of nodes is based on their (integer) [[id]]s. 
 

<<>>=
module Export = struct
    module NSet = Set.Make(Compare)
    module A    = Ast

    <<module Export>>
end
@

The main problem of translating a [[cfg]] to an [[Ast.stmt]] [[list]]
is to express the sharing that is inherent in a [[cfg]].  Sharing is
expressed by introducing labels at points where control flow paths
join, and [[goto]]s, where paths split.  Consequently, labels for
nodes must be invented.  The function [[label_of]] returns a label for
a node.  In case the node is a [[Label]], it includes a label and this
one is used.  Otherwise, a label is generated from the node's [[id]]. 

<<module Export>>=
let label_of mangle node = 
    let proc = fst (cfg_of node).init in
    let x = match node.kind with
        | Label(l,n) -> l
        | _          -> Printf.sprintf "%s %d" proc node.id 
    in
        mangle x
@

A [[cuts]] value bundles a number of nodes. These are identified by
names in the {\AST} and as such, names must be generated for them.
[[flows]] creates an [[Ast.cuts]] value from a [[cuts]] value.

<<>>=
let flows mangle cuts = 
        [ A.CutsTo     (List.map (label_of mangle) cuts.cuts)
        ; A.UnwindsTo  (List.map (label_of mangle) cuts.unwinds)
        ; A.ReturnsTo  (List.map (label_of mangle) cuts.returns)
        ]  @ if   cuts.aborts
             then [A.Aborts]
             else [] 
@

The translation of a [[cfg]] to a [[stmt]] [[list]] works from a
[[cfg]]'s entry node in a depth-first search.  The current node is
translated, and any newly discovered node put onto a [[todo]] stack. 
This stack is then processed by either calling [[nextstmt]] or
[[termstmt]].  When the current node does end the current path of
control, like [[goto]], [[return]], or [[jump]] it is a terminating
node and [[termstmt]] is called, and [[nextstmt]] otherwise.  The
reason for having these two different functions are shared nodes: 
when the next node on the [[todo]] stack is shared, the current path
of control must be closed with a [[goto]] to that node.  When the
current path is already closed, no such [[goto]] must be created
(although it would not harm).  Below are the functions for the
translation of the different kind of nodes.

Because of the depth-first processing of the [[cfg]], the exit node is
usually \emph{not} processed last.  The [[exit]] node is therefore
translated to a generic [[return]] statement.  \emph{Is [[0/0]] legal
{\PAL}?}
             
<<>>=
let rec exitStmt visited mangle todo = 
    A.CommentStmt "exit" :: returnStmt visited mangle todo (0,0) 
@

Given the introduction above, the translation of most nodes is
straight forward.

<<>>=
and entryStmt visited mangle todo next = 
    A.CommentStmt "entry" :: nextstmt visited mangle (next :: todo)

and gotoStmt visited mangle todo (expr, nodes) =
    let f n  = label_of mangle n in
    let goto = A.GotoStmt (Rtl2ast.expr mangle expr, List.map f nodes) in
    goto :: termstmt visited mangle (nodes @ todo)
@    
 
We do not try to recover the large scale control flow structure of the
original program.  A branch is translated into an [[if]] with one
[[goto]] and a fall-trough case. 

This code relied on the fact that the left node is labeled. Since the
left node is not necessarily shared, it otherwise won't be labeled in
the output and thus the goto 
   
<<>>=

The [[dispatch]] function handles all the different kind of nodes and
calls the respective function from above. No magic involved.

<<>>=

    | Cutto (expr,cuts)     -> cutStmt     visited mangle todo (expr,cuts)
    | _                     -> assert false
@

When a shared node is visited the first time, it must be labeled such
that all other paths into this node generate a [[goto]] towards it. 
The [[label]] function returns a label-statement for such a node. 
When a shared node and previously visited node is encountered, a
[[goto]] to this node must be generated.  Since the node was visited
before, the corresponding label was already generated.  The [[goto]]
function creates the [[goto]] Statement.


<<>>=
and label mangle node =
    A.LabelStmt(label_of mangle node)         

and goto mangle node =
    let x    = label_of mangle node in
    let expr = A.Fetch(A.Var(None,x)) in
        A.GotoStmt(expr,[])
@

As explained above, the translation of a [[cfg]] into a [[Ast.stmt]]
[[list]] is a depth-first traversal of the [[cfg]]. The details are
handled by the [[stmt]] function.

\begin{itemize}
\item The first argument [[terminal]] is [[true]], if the statement generated
      last ends a control flow path and control flow thus never falls
      through into the node on top of the [[todo]] stack. 

\item The translation of a [[cfg]] is complete, if the [[todo]] stack
      is empty.

\item Otherwise, the top element is removed from the stack and added
      to the set of [[visited']] set.

\item Most nodes lie on a path and have exactly one predecessors, that
      is, they are not on different paths. These are simply passed to
      [[dispatch]] to be translated. 

\item A node with more that one predecessor is shared between
      different paths and requires special treatment. If it is visited
      the first time, a label must be generated, before it can be
      [[dispatch]]'ed. 

\item A shared node that has been visited before must not be visited again
      to not generate the same code twice.  When such a node is
      encountered, it must not be processed but a [[goto]] to this
      node must be generated instead.  However, if the previously
      generated statement never passes control to the node at hand
      ([[terminal]] is [[true]]), this [[goto]] can be omitted. 

\item A node with just one predecessor on the [[todo]] stack can never
      been visited twice:  after it was processed the first time, any
      second path trough this node must enter a shared note dominating
      the node at hand.  Because the shared node was also visited, it
      is not entered a second time on the [[todo]] stack, but a
      [[goto]] to it is generated instead.  Consequently, the node at
      hand never gets pushed a second time on the [[todo]] stack.

\item Please see the comments above about [[branch]] nodes.

to nodes.  The [[stmts]] function translates a [[cfg]] to a list of
statements such that it can be visualized via pretty printing the
{\AST}.  And [[init]] provides access to the value stored in a [[cfg]]
when it is created.

\section{Lowering Copy-In and Copy-Out Nodes}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The flow graph of a procedure, as part of the assembly program emitted
by the \module{ast2ir} module, contains so-called copy-in and copy-out
nodes.  They represent the conventions for parameter passing on an
abstract level.  When the calling conventions are known, these nodes
can be replaced by sequences of nodes that pass parameters in
registers and memory.  This module transforms a flow graph to a
slightly different flow-graph without copy-nodes.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Interface}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

This module provides a functor [[Make]] that creates a
module, that implements an abstract flow graph. The implementation of
[[MakeLowerCopy]] has itself a (lower-level) implementation of an
abstract flow-graph available. 

The flow-graph implementation created by [[Make]] will represent
[[copy_in]] and [[copy_out]] nodes in terms of simpler nodes.  We
reveal some facts of the implementation using [[with]] constraints.

<<lowercopy.mli>>=
module Make(G: Acfg.S): Acfg.S 
    with type cfg        = G.cfg
    with type init       = G.init
@

% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Implementation}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The implementation for the most part just uses the lower level
implementation [[G]] to define the new one. Only two functions
actually differ from the implementation in [[G]]: [[copy_in]] and
[[copy_out]]. 

<<lowercopy.ml>>=
module Make(G: Acfg.S) = struct
    module A  = Automaton
    module T  = Target
    <<module make>>
end
@

A [[copy]] node is implemented as a sequence of [[G.node]]s from the
lower-level implementation.  Since properties can be bound later to a
node we have a problem:  the [[bind]] function must bind the
properties to all nodes that represent a [[copy]] node.  We solve the
problem by escaping to higher order functions:  a [[unode]] is
represented as a function.  A typical call like [[exit g]] creates a
function [[unode]] that expects properties.  Only after the properties
are supplied, the implementation is invoked.  This permits the
implementation to use the properties.  In case of the [[copy]] nodes
the properties can be passed to all primitive nodes that implement a
[[copy]] node. 
 
<<module make>>=
type init       = G.init
type cfg        = G.cfg
type node       = G.node
type unode      = G.Props.t -> G.node

module Props    = G.Props

let bind props unode = unode props

let create          = G.create
let cfg_of          = G.cfg_of
let exit g p        = G.bind p (G.exit g) 
let entry n p       = G.bind p (G.entry n)
let goto g e l p    = G.bind p (G.goto g e l)
let branch e x y p  = G.bind p (G.branch e x y)
let assign r n p    = G.bind p (G.assign r n)
let call e n c p    = G.bind p (G.call e n c)
let jump g e l p    = G.bind p (G.jump g e l)
let cutto g e c p   = G.bind p (G.cutto g e c)
let label l n p     = G.bind p (G.label l n)
let return g x y p  = G.bind p (G.return g x y)

\subsubsection{Copy-In}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The [[copy_in]] node is responsible for receiving parameters passed
from a call to a procedure, from a return to the point of return, or
from a cut to a continuation.  The location of the parameters are
determined by an [[Automaton.t]] that is part of the calling
convention [[conv]].  The formal parameters [[formals]] are pushed
through the automaton to obtain the locations of the incoming
parameters.  An incoming value is assigned to its corresponding
variable from the list of formal parameters.

<<copyio>>=
let copyi formals context conv after props =
    let dfa = ( match context with
              | Acfg.ProcParameters -> conv.T.proc_param
              | Acfg.ProcResults    -> conv.T.proc_result
              | Acfg.ContParameters -> conv.T.proc_param
              ) in
    let rec loop dfa = function  
        | []         -> after
        | frml :: ff ->
            let (write,read),dfa = A.Run.next dfa (Types.bits frml.Acfg.width
                                                  , frml.Acfg.hint
                                                  ) in
            let var = Rtl.Var ( frml.Acfg.name
                              , frml.Acfg.index
                              , frml.Acfg.width
                              )        in
            let t     = Rtl.Const(Rtl.Bool(true))         in
            let store = Rtl.Store(var,read,frml.Acfg.width) in
            let rtl   = Rtl.Rtl [t,store]                 in
                assign rtl (loop dfa ff) props
    in
        loop dfa formals
@

% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Copy-Out}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

A [[copy_out]] node takes the values of actual parameters and puts
them into locations determined by calling conventions.  A [[copy_out]]
node is typically followed by a call, or a [[cut to]] that transfers
control to code that receives the values. 

Constructing the {\rtl} that assigns the value of an actual parameter
to a location is easy: the calling convention automaton returns a
function [[write: Rtl.expr -> Rtl.effect]] that assigns a supplied
value to the right location.
              
<<copyio>>=
let copyo actuals context conv after props = 
    let dfa = ( match context with
              | Acfg.ProcParameters -> conv.T.proc_param
              | Acfg.ProcResults    -> conv.T.proc_result
              | Acfg.ContParameters -> conv.T.proc_param
              ) in
    let rec loop dfa = function  
        | []                     -> after
        | (expr,width,hint):: ff ->
            let (write,read),dfa = A.Run.next dfa ( Types.bits width
                                                  , hint
                                                  )       in
            let t     = Rtl.Const(Rtl.Bool(true))         in
            let rtl   = Rtl.Rtl [t,write expr]            in
                assign rtl (loop dfa ff) props
    in
        loop dfa actuals
