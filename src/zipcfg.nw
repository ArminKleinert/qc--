\section{Applicative Control-Flow Graph, Based on Huet's Zipper}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 


\citet{huet:zipper} describes a generalization of a tree that enables
a program to focus on a single node while enabling the context (e.g.,
parents) to be represented by an explicit, reified value (as opposed
to being captured in an implicit continuation).
We investigate this idea for a control-flow graph.

Every graph has a single entry and zero or more exits.
(For example, the graph for a procedure has no exits, the graph
for an expanded instruction has one exit, and the graph for an
expanded conditional branch has two exits.)
Exits are numbered from~$0$.
A~[[graph]] is a set of basic blocks, one of which is distinguished as the
entry block.
Every other block is tagged by a
unique id, which may correspond to a string label.\footnote
{Maintaining a mapping between strings and unique ids is not the
  responsibility of this module.}
A~[[zgraph]] is a graph with the \emph{focus} on one particular node.
This will support at least the following kinds of operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item
When the focus is on the entry node, add a new node to the graph just
before the entry node.
This operation is the primary means of building graphs.
\item
Replace the node at the focus, plugging in a new graph in its place.
\end{itemize}
Here are some basic types and operations:
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
type uid
type label = uid * string

type regs  = Register.Set.t  (* sets of regs for dataflow *)
type xregs = Register.SetX.t (* sets of regs for dataflow *)
type contedge = { kills:regs; defs:regs; node:label }

module Rep : sig
  <<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>
  <<declarations of [[Rep]]'s public functions>>
end

type graph
type zgraph

val empty   : graph
val entry   : graph -> zgraph           (* focus on entry node *)
val exit    : int -> graph -> zgraph    (* focus on exit node *)
val focus   : uid -> graph -> zgraph    (* focus on node with uid *)
val unfocus : zgraph -> graph           (* lose focus *)
@ 
Subgraph replacement:
we replace the node at the focus with a graph.
The number of exits in the replacement graph must be equal to the
number of successors of the focus node; otherwise it is a checked run-time
error. 
After replacement, the focus looks at the successor of the replacement
graph's entry node.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val replace_focus : zgraph -> graph -> zgraph
@ 
We can insert a single-entry, single-exit subgraph either before or
after the current focus.
If before, the focus must be on a [[middle]] or [[last]] node.
If after, the focus must be on a [[first]] or [[middle]] node.
The focus does not move.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val splice_before : zgraph -> graph -> zgraph
val splice_after  : zgraph -> graph -> zgraph
@ 
Stitch two graphs together:
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val followed_by : graph -> int -> graph -> graph
  (* followed_by g n g' = connect Exit n of g to entry of g' *)
@ 
Sometimes we just want to add blocks to an existing graph~[[g]].
We do it by creating a fresh graph~[[gz]]; the focus should be on the
entry node, which becomes unreachable.
The exit node of the new graph should also be unreachable.
The code is used in [[Ast2ir]] to add a continuation's prolog.

This is pretty ugly; it's a consequence of our being willing to insert
new nodes only following an entry node.  Maybe something less ugly is
lurking somewhere.  
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val add_blocks : graph -> zgraph -> graph
@ 
Building a graph.
The entry plays a dual role here; every constructor effectively
requires the focus be on the entry node and inserts a new node
following the entry node.
After insertion, the entry node remains the focus.

%%  When we add a node that can flow through to its successor, we insert
%%  the node before the focus.
%%  But when we add a node that cannot flow to its successor, we add it to
%%  an unfocused graph.
%%  In either case,  the new node becomes the new focus.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val uid : unit -> uid
type machine = { goto    : label -> Rtl.rtl;
                 cbranch : Rtl.exp * label -> Rtl.rtl;
                 bnegate : Rtl.rtl -> Rtl.rtl;
                 call    : Rtl.exp -> Rtl.rtl;
                 forbidden : Rtl.rtl;
               }

val label        : machine -> label -> zgraph -> zgraph  (* spans? *)
val instruction  : Rtl.rtl -> zgraph -> zgraph
val stack_adjust : Rtl.rtl -> zgraph -> zgraph
val assertion    : Rtl.rtl -> zgraph -> zgraph
val branch       : machine -> label -> zgraph -> zgraph
val jump         : Rtl.rtl -> uses:regs -> targets:string list -> zgraph -> zgraph
val cbranch      : machine -> Rtl.exp -> ifso:label -> ifnot:label -> zgraph -> zgraph

val return       : Rtl.rtl -> exit:int -> uses:regs -> zgraph -> zgraph
val forbidden    : machine -> zgraph -> zgraph
  (* control should not reach; causes checked RTE *)
@ 
Sometimes we need to make the current focus (which must be the entry)
a branch target to be used later.
Calling [[make_target gz]] returns a new graph and a unique identifier
to which the entry flows in.

val make_target : machine -> zgraph -> label * zgraph

\subsubsection{Exposure}

A basic block is a [[first]] node, followed by zero or more [[middle]]
nodes, followed by a [[last]] node.
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type 'a edgelist = 'a list (* could be array *)
<<node types>>
type first
  = Entry
  | Label of label * user * Spans.t option ref  (* user labels can't be deleted *)
and user = User of bool  (* is label a user label? *)

type middle
  = Instruction  of Rtl.rtl
  | Stack_adjust of Rtl.rtl
  | Assertion    of Rtl.rtl

type last
  = Exit    of exit_num  
  | Branch  of Rtl.rtl * label
  | Cbranch of Rtl.rtl * label * label    (* true, false *)
  | Mbranch of Rtl.rtl * label edgelist (* possible successors *)
  | Call    of call  
  | Cut     of Rtl.rtl * contedge edgelist * regs  (* out edges, registers used *)
  | Return  of exit_num * Rtl.rtl * regs
  | Jump    of Rtl.rtl * regs * string list
                   (* inst, registers used, targets *)
  | Forbidden of Rtl.rtl (* cause a run-time error *)
and exit_num = int
@ In a complete graph for a procedure, the [[Exit]] node should not
appear, but it is useful in a subgraph (e.g., replacement for a node).
Also, perhaps a [[Jump]] should get an exit number?  Not really clear.
@
To sequence these things,
a~[[head]] is a [[first]] followed by zero or more [[middle]]s.
A~[[tail]] is  zero or more [[middle]]s followed by a [[last]].
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type head = First of first | Head of head * middle
type tail = Last  of last  | Tail of middle * tail
@
And now the zipper.
In the future, we may well simplify these to just two cases.
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type zblock
  = Start  of first * tail           (* focus on first *)
  | Middle of head * middle * tail   (* focus on middle *)
  | End    of head * last            (* focus on last *)
@ An alternative would be to make [[type zblock = head * tail]], with
focus on the first element of the tail.  Not sure if that is flexible
enough, however---it is often useful to focus on a [[first]] node.

Another alternative would be to inline the definitions of [[first]] and
[[last]] into [[head]] and [[tail]], doing away with a level of
indirection.
But this would probably make it harder for clients to reason about
nodes in isolation.
@
A block need not be in zipper form:
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type block = first * tail
@ 
We expose some utility functions:
<<declarations of [[Rep]]'s public functions>>=
val id : block -> uid

val zip   : zblock -> block
val unzip : block  -> zblock

val first      : zblock -> first
val last       : zblock -> last
val goto_start : zblock -> first * tail
val goto_end   : zblock -> head  * last
@ 
Access to the representation:
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val to_blocks : graph -> Rep.block Unique.Map.t
val of_blocks : Rep.block Unique.Map.t -> graph
@ 
Traversal: [[postorder_dfs]] returns a list of blocks reachable from
the entry node.
The postorder depth-first-search order means the list is in roughly
first-to-last order, as suitable for use in a forward dataflow problem.

It is OK to open [[Rep]] because the definition is sitting right
here---this [[open]] does not create the stereotypical problem of a
mysterious [[open]] from a separately compiled module.
