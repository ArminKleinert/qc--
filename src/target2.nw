\section{Target Platform Description}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

{\qcc} is a cross compiler:  code can be generated for a target
platform different from the platform the compiler is executed on.  The
target platform can be chosen at run-time of the compiler. 
Consequently, targets must be described by an {\ocaml} value that can
be passed at run-time (rather than by a module, which can not). 

<<target2.mli>>=
<<type cc>>
<<type map>>
<<type space>>
<<type t>>
val dummy: t        (* our only target for now *)
@

<<type t>>=
type t = { <<components of t>> }
@

A target is described by many small informations like pointer sizes
and one bigger chunk that describe calling conventions.  A single
platform can implement many calling conventions, which are identified
by names.  Calling conventions are not only selected at run-time, we
also intend to construct them at run-time.  For the time being,
however, we will rely on a fixed set of calling conventions.  

A calling convention includes specifications for automata that
implement calling conventions.  In {\PAL} parameters are passed in
three different contexts:  into procedures, into continuations, and
out of both using [[return]].  Therefore, three different
specifications exist.

<<type cc>>=
type cc =      
    { sp:       Rtl.loc           (* stack pointer                             *)
    ; return:   Rtl.rtl           (* return machine instr passed to Cfg.return *)
    ; proc:     Automaton.spec    (* pass parameter to a procedure      *)
    ; cont:     Automaton.spec    (* pass parameter to a contunation    *)
    ; ret:      Automaton.spec    (* return values                      *)
    }
@

To obtain a calling convention, pass its name to the [[cc]] component
which will return the convention response.  It is a checked run-time
error to ask for an unknown calling convention.

<<components of t>>=
cc: string -> cc; (* raises Error.Exn if name is unknown *)
@

Many of the following characteristics of a target are more or less
obvious.  A {\PAL} source can name hardware registers for variables. 
The [[register]] component provides the location for a given name.  We
could remember the width for type checking as well but ee are wearing
our assembler hats for now.

<<components of t>>=
byteorder:      Rtl.aggregation   ; (* big/little endian, id *)
wordsize:       int               ; (* bits *)
pointersize:    int               ; (* bits *)
memsize:        int               ; (* smallest addressable unit, typically 8 *)
float:          string            ; (* "ieee754" float representation    *)
charset:        string            ; (* "latin1"  character encoding      *)
globals:        Automaton.spec    ; (* Automaton to allocate global vars *)
register:       string -> Rtl.loc ; (* rtl for named hardware register   *)
                                    (*XXX Register.t instead *)          
                                      
@

The nodes in the control-flow graph (module \module{cfg}) contain
target-specific {\rtl}s.  For example, a [[jump]] node takes an {\rtl}
and not an expression for the target.  The construction of these
{\rtl}s is target specific and so we provide [[embed]] functions that
allows to do it.  For debugging of the {\cfg} we also like to
re-construct the expressions from these {\rtl}s.  We provide matching
[[project]] functions to obtain the original expressions \emph{if the
supplied {\rtl}s} were constructed by the construction functions.  Any
attempt to do otherwise results in an unchecked run-time error. 

<<type map>>=
type 'a map =   { embed:    ('a -> Rtl.rtl)
                ; project:  (Rtl.rtl -> 'a)
                }
<<components of t>>=
goto:           Rtl.exp map ;
jump:           Rtl.exp map ;
cutto:          Rtl.exp map ;
call:           Rtl.exp map ;
branch:         (Rtl.exp * Rtl.exp) map;
@

The register allocator (see \module{linscan}) needs target-specific
informations about hardware registers and temporaries. In particular:

<<components of t>>=
fits:           Rtl.space -> Register.t -> bool;
is_tmp:         Rtl.space -> bool;
allocatable:    Register.t list;
@

\begin{itemize}
\item [[fits sp r]] is true, if (hardware) register [[r]] can hold any 
      value from space [[sp]].

\item [[is_tmp sp]] is true, if [[sp]] denotes a {\rtl} space that
      holds temporaries.

\item [[allocatable]] is the list of registers that are available for 
      register allocation on this platform.
\end{itemize}


A target has many address spaces:  main memory, different register
sets, temporaries.  A [[Rtl.loc]] value describes a location within
such a space.  Each space is homogenous in the sense that all its
cells have the same width.  When cells within one space are aggregated
a common aggregation scheme is used, described by a space-specific
[[Rtl.aggregation]] value.  The cells within a space are addressed by
an integer expression denoting their \emph{address}.  All address
expressions for a space share a common width.  For example, memory
might by addressed by 32-bit wide addresses, registers by 5-bit wide
addresses. 

<<type space>>=
type space =    { cellwidth:    int
                ; aggregation:  Rtl.aggregation
                ; addrwidth:    int
                }
@
                
The [[space]] function returns a description of a given
space. It is a checked run-time error to ask for the description of an
unknown space.

<<components of t>>=
space:          Rtl.space -> space;
@

\begin{quote}\it
    Target properties like [[pointersize]], or [[memsize]] are just
    properties of the [[m]] [[space]]. I like the more general idea
    of address spaces but I'm not sure whether we should get rid of the
    more specialized properties or should keep them as abbreviations.
    The hole problem stems from the fact that I only over time begin
    to understand what describes a target. --CL

\subsection{Implementation}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The implementation does not hold any surprises. We use module [[Map]]
to implement lookup tables for registers and calling conventions.

<<target2.ml>>=
module StrMap  = Map.Make(struct type t=string let compare=compare end)
module CharMap = Map.Make(struct type t=char   let compare=compare end)

module MapUtil (M: Map.S) = struct
    let lookup map key =
        try  M.find key map 
        with Not_found -> Impossible.impossible ("Target.lookup key not found")

    let list2map assoc =
        let add map (key,value) = M.add key value map in
        List.fold_left add M.empty assoc  
end

module StrUtil  = MapUtil(StrMap)
module CharUtil = MapUtil(CharMap) 

<<type map>>
<<type cc>>
<<type space>>
<<type t>>
<<dummy>>
@

<<dummy>>=

let m = { embed   = (fun _ -> assert false)
        ; project = (fun _ -> assert false)
        }

let spaces = CharUtil.list2map
    [('m',{ cellwidth   =Dummy.wordsize
          ; aggregation =Dummy.byteorder 
          ; addrwidth   =Dummy.pointersize
          })
    ]      
          
let dummy: t = 
    { byteorder       = Dummy.byteorder
    ; wordsize        = Dummy.wordsize
    ; pointersize     = Dummy.pointersize
    ; memsize         = Dummy.memsize
    ; float           = Dummy.float
    ; charset         = Dummy.charset
    ; globals         = Automaton.dummy
    ; register        = StrUtil.lookup StrMap.empty (* no registers *)
    ; goto            = m
    ; jump            = m
    ; cutto           = m
    ; call            = m
    ; branch          = m
    ; cc              = StrUtil.lookup StrMap.empty
    ; fits            = (fun sp (sp',index,width) -> sp = sp')
    ; is_tmp          = (fun sp -> sp = 't')
    ; allocatable     = [] (* need something more sensible *)
    ; space           = fun sp -> CharUtil.lookup spaces sp
    }
