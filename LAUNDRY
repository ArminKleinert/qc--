* Implement charset, character, and string handling as proposed by NR
  in the changes file.  The current handling of characters and
  strings must be replaced. 

* Constant evaluation: elab.nw contains a constant evaluation (against
  Fenv.Dirty) and ast2ir.nw needs a constant evaluation (against
  Fenv.Clean). The plan is, to use some IR technology for this which
  is not yet in place.
