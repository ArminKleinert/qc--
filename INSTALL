This documents describes how to build the QC-- compiler from source
code and lays out a road map of the source code.

Prerequisites

The compiler is written in the functional programming language
Objective Caml (http://caml.inria.fr). Most of the source code is
written as a literate program using the Noweb literate programming
tool.  The documentation is intended to be formatted with for the
LaTeX type setting system. The build process is controlled by the
make-like tool mk. Mk is the build tool of the Plan 9 operating system.

To build the compiler from source code you need:

        * Objective Caml 3.00 installation
        * mk 
        * Noweb 2.9
        * LaTeX

Building

The recursive build process is controlled by mkfile's for mk. All
mkfile's include the file config/ocaml.mk that contains the rules for
compiling OCaml source files. It is thus the central file to changes
paths or compiler options.

        config/ocaml.mk         mk rules for OCaml
        mkfile                  top-level mkfile
        cllib/mkfile
        src/mkfile
        test/mkfile

To compile everuthing call mk in this directory:

        % mk

This starts the compilation process. The resultin files are:

        bin/qc--            qc-- native code binary 
        man/man1/qc--.1     manual page

To execute the test suite you can also call the test target:

        % mk test


Roadmap

The source code of the compiler is split into different directories. 
The top level mkfile knows the dependencies between them and makes
them in the right order.  Files shared by many directories go into the
lib/ directory which is initially empty.  Once all shared files are in
place development can be continued in the sub-directories and the
mkfiles provided there. Refer to the mkfiles for the high level
targets available in each directory.
