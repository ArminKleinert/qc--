                        The Quick C-- Compiler

              ``Bringing you compiler technology that is well
              understood, but difficult to implement'' 
                                                         
This directory contains the source code for the Quick C-- compiler for
the C-- language.  C-- is an intermediate language for compilers with
a concrete syntax.  Informations about C-- and the Quick C-- compiler
can be found at: http://www.cminusminus.org

For building the compiler from source code see the INSTALL document. 
The INSTALL document also contains a road map the the source code
organization.

Once the compiler is build from source code, or, if you are looking at
a binary distribution, the compiler binary qc-- can be found in the
bin/ directory. The Unix style manual page is man/man1/qc--.1.

The Quick C-- compiler is still under development. Please see the
