                    QC-- The Quick C-- Compiler

              ``Bringing you compiler technology that is well
              understood, but difficult to implement'' 
                                                         
This directory contains the source code for the QC-- compiler for the
C-- language.  C-- is an intermediate language for compilers with a
concrete syntax.  Informations about C-- and the QC-- compiler can be
found at:  http://www.cminusminus.org

For building the compiler from source code see the INSTALL document. 
The INSTALL document also contains a road map the the source code
organization.

Once the compiler is build from source code, or, if you are looking at
a binary distribution, the compiler binary qc-- can be found in the
bin/ directory. The Unix style manual page is man/man1/qc--.1.

        INSTALL                 How to build qc-- from source.

The QC-- compiler is still under development. Please see the manual
page for how to invoke the compiler.
