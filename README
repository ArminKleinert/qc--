                            The Quick C-- Compiler

This directory contains source code for qc--, the quick c-- compiler.

BUILDING

Run mk(1) to build the compiler:

      % mk 

Binaries and man page end up in bin/ and man/. Documentation can be
generated inside the src/ directory by calling:

        mk dvi 
    or  mk ps
    or  mk html

The resulting file is qc--.{dvi,ps,html}.
