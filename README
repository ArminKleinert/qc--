                        The Quick C-- Compiler

              ``Bringing you compiler technology that is well
              understood, but difficult to implement'' 
                                                         
This directory contains the source code for the Quick C-- compiler for
the C-- language.  C-- is an intermediate language for compilers with
a concrete syntax.  Informations about C-- and the Quick C-- compiler
can be found at: http://www.cminusminus.org

For building the compiler from source code see the INSTALL document. 
The INSTALL document also contains a road map the the source code
organization.

Once the compiler is build from source code, or, if you are looking at
a binary distribution, the compiler binary qc-- can be found in the
bin/ directory. The Unix style manual page is man/man1/qc--.1.

The Quick C-- compiler is still under development. Please see the
manual page for how to invoke the compiler.  Please see doc/release.*
for release notes.

The name `Quick C--' belongs to us, but the code is available free for
any use in any field of endeavor.  You may redistribute Quick C-- in
whole or in part.  We ask that, as a matter of courtesy, you
acknowledge its source and include this README file.  You may modify
Quick C-- and create derived works, with which you may do as you like,
but the result may not be called Quick C-- without written consent.

We want absolutely everyone to be able to use Quick C-- with
confidence.  To that end, the software is placed in the public domain.
It is not protected by copyright, and it is not protected by a
``copyleft'' agreement like the one used by the Free Software
Foundation.
