                    QC-- The Quick C-- Compiler

              ``Bringing you compiler technology that is well
              understood, but difficult to implement'' 
                                                         
This directory contains the source code for the QC-- compiler for the
C-- language. C-- is an intermediate language for compilers with a
concrete syntax. Informations about C-- and the QC-- compiler can be
found at: http://cminusminus.eecs.harvard.edu/.

For building the compiler from source code see the INSTALL document. 
The INSTALL document also contains a road map the the source code
organization.

Once the compiler is build from source code, or, if you are looking at
a binary distribution, the compiler binary qc-- can be found in the
bin/ directory. The Unix style manual page is man/man1/qc--.1.

        bin/qc--                Compiler binary.
        man/man1/qc--.1         Manual page.
        INSTALL                 How to build qc-- from source.

The QC-- compiler is still under development. It currently can perform
the following actions:

        qc-- -version           Shows the current version.
        
        qc-- -help              Command line summary.
        
        qc-- -lex file.c--      Scan file.c-- and report write token
                                stream to stdout. Useful for debuging
                                the scanner.
        
        qc-- -asdl file.c--     Parse file.c-- and write abstract syntax
                                in ASDL format to stdout.
        
        qc-- -pp file.c--       Parse file.c-- and pretty print the
                                abstract syntax back to stdout.

        qc-- -pp -w 35 file.c-- The pretty printer now uses a line
                                length of 35 characters. The default
                                is 72.

        qc-- -check file.c--    Check the static semantics of file.c--.

Some examples of C-- source code can be found in the examples/
directory.
