First, in order to compile the code, you need to "mk clean" at the
top-level. This is necessary in order to remove the source code for
the evaluating instantiations. Running "mk" in this directory will
extract the residualising instantiations from the same Noweb files.

----------------------------------------

The code as it is right now does not compile. In order to obtain a
residualizing instance, one needs to generate the coresponding code
using the SML TDPE generator, from

cvs -d ~damian/Repository co nbegen

and run it with the appropriate parameters.

But wait: even if you do that, it will still not compile. You need to
generate the encoder and the recognizer with the toolkit. Even then,
the generated code needs to be edited by hand to compile properly.

In conclusion, better wait until a real implementation is available.
