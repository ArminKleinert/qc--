To compile the code in this directory, apart from the other tools
needed to compile qc--, you will need the source code of your OCaml
compiler.  Use the "OCAMLSOURCES" variable in the "mkfile" to control
the location of your local instalation of the OCaml source code. I
suggest the OCaml-3.00 version.

   (The source code is needed to compile an external object function
    which is used to implement a stack-copying callcc (experimental
    code due to Xavier Leroy and Olivier Danvy).  The implementation
    of TDPE is based on "callcc". To compile the C object function,
    you need the source code of the OCaml compiler.)

Due to the use of callcc, the program can be compiled only to
bytecode, and not to native code.

Compilation:

  - Do a "mk clean" at the top-level of the qc-- distribution. This is
    needed in order to remove the .ml and .mli source code of the
    evaluating instantiations in the "/src" directory. 

  - run "mk". Running "mk" in this directory will extract the
    residualising instantiations from the same Noweb files.

mkfile variables:

  - The "MACHINE" variable determines the target machine-instruction
    set. The machine-dependent code is expected to be found in the
    current directory.

    Machine-dependent code is provided for: one01 (a simplistic
    calculator), one02 (another version of the simplistic calculator)
    and a version of the Sparc instruction set.

Command line-options:

   - run "main -help" for a list of options.

To read the source-code documentation, run "mk html" and start with
main.html.

----------------------------------------

If you want to generate residualizing instances for _other instruction
sets_, get the SML code from CVS:

cvs -d ~damian/Repository co nbegen

and run it with the appropriate parameters. Look into "main.nw" there
for details.

Be warned: even if you do that, it will still not compile. You need to
generate the encoder and the recognizer with the toolkit. Even then,
the generated code still needs small editing by hand in order to
compile properly.
